### Exploring Improvements ###

1. Special Terrain features with bonuses to resources uncovered during the exploring action
2. Terrain features affect adjacent tiles
3. Add fuel for crafting / harvesting structures
4. Firewood -> Charcoal -> Coal -> Magic sources

10.  Multi tile exploring (could cause problems determining which tile to explore next)


Sources: 
Vein-Specific / Groups:
Ore => Vein
Wood => Grove
Stone =>  Deposit/Bed/Cluster
Hides => Trove

Problem:
 Assuming there are 5 different copper ores with randomly created properties at world generation and assuming resource regionality is implemented, 
 after the player has uncovered the nearby copper ore, the resource will be viewed as static in the player's mind.  They will know the exact properties of any new
 uncovered copper ore nearby which eliminates any of the "element of discovery" emotion in the player.  

Proposed Solution:
A specific source's properties would be randomly generated at explore time not world generation.  

The dynamic properties causes item stacking to be become problemtic, the implementation of sources should help mitigate this issue.  
For example, a specific vein source would create ore items the exact same properties and hence be stackable.  

Merging or Mixing (???)
Ore items from different veins could be merged or mixed together.  Does it make sense for stone or wood or plants or hides? 
    Should mixing only be available at the sub type "Copper Ore" or the specific "Valleyrun Copper Ore"
    Is then mixing allowed at the ingot level?  
    Appears to make more sense that the mixing should happen at the refined good level?        


Pros:
    1. This will allow the player to experience the element of discovery and provide an incentive to explore.

Cons: 
    1. The randomness of the resource properties could frustrate the player if they are looking for any amount of a specific resource. 








Vein-Specific Attributes: Each vein of ore, grove of trees, or patch of plants could have unique attributes. For example, a vein of copper might yield ore that's naturally more conductive, or a forest area might produce wood that's unusually durable. Players would mine or harvest the entire vein or area, with all resources from that specific source sharing the same attributes.

Regional Variations: Different regions or biomes could impart unique properties to resources found there. For example, copper ore from a desert region might be sun-hardened, while the same ore from a swampy area could have moisture-resistant properties.

Seasonal or Temporal Effects: Resources gathered during certain seasons or under specific celestial events (like a full moon) could have special properties. This would encourage timely exploration and gathering.

Ancient or Mythical Sources: Discoverable legendary sources of resources, like an ancient copper mine or a mythical grove, could provide resources with rare and unique properties. These would be finite and highly sought after.

Environmental Influences: The environment surrounding the resource could affect its properties. For example, copper ore near a volcanic area could be naturally heat-resistant, while wood from a forest frequently hit by lightning could have enhanced magical properties.

Resource Infusion: Allow players to infuse resources with elements found in their environment. For instance, soaking wood in a magical spring or exposing ore to rare cosmic events could grant them unique properties.

Harvesting Method Impact: The method or tool used for harvesting could influence the properties of the resources. Using a special enchanted pickaxe might yield ore with magical properties, whereas a standard pickaxe would yield regular ore.

Combination Effects: When resources are gathered from areas close to each other, they could combine properties. For instance, harvesting wood near a copper vein might give the wood conductive properties.

Ecosystem Interactions: The presence of certain flora or fauna near the resource could impart unique attributes. For example, hides from animals living near a mineral-rich water source might be naturally tougher.

Magical or Elemental Zones: Areas imbued with magic or elemental forces could affect the properties of resources found there, like stones in a mana-rich area being naturally enchanted.
